Bachelor of Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, with two years of experience as a researcher in the field of compilers and operating systems. My research interests include containerized environments, code optimization, virtual machines, processor emulators, and interprocess communication.

I am a member of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS), and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

I was a researcher on the Nanvix project, supervised by Dr. Pedro Henrique Penna. I specialized in compilers and operating systems at Nanvix, participating in the development of a virtual machine using C and C++. In particular, I worked on a Just-In-Time (JIT) translation mechanism for the Nanvix operating system emulator, which translated MIPS assembly instructions to the RISC-V processor.

My undergraduate thesis, supervised by [Dr. Pedro Henrique Penna](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ppenna/), Senior Research Software Engineer at Microsoft Research, and [Dr. Henrique Cota Freitas](https://www.cart-research.com/team/henrique), professor at ICEI - PUCMINAS, proposed a library for interprocess communication in a microkernel architecture using the zero-copy technique.
